# webdriverio-azure
From this work , I used visual studio code for writing the code and all. 
install npm and used webdriveio 
npm run test --> worked well in both browser . Here I used maximum intances 5 and chome and firefox nighty are the browsers . 
Then I  tried to use dockerize the image , it worked well in my docker on my local system. 
Again I tried Azure pipeline . In this propcess firstly a linked my repo to Azure and create a pipeline.yml file afte I run the project it showed some warning error . It has some limitations to use Azure. 
Overall , I used npm, webdriverio,docker, azure pipeline aswell. 
Result: Automation testing worked well in both browsers. 

Used Commands :
npm installation
npm webdriverio intstalation:
- npm init
- npm intstall webdriverio --save-dev
- npm install @wdio/cli'
- ./node_modules/.bin/wdio config
- npm install chai --save-dev
- npm install chai-webdriverio --save-dev
